## 🌟 The Power of Algorithms Behind Google

Let’s look into how algorithmic thinking makes these services robust:

### Google Search  
Handles **81.95%** of the global search traffic. Optimization in query parsing, ranking, and indexing is crucial to keep results lightning fast and relevant.

### YouTube  
With over **2 billion** monthly users, recommendation systems powered by collaborative filtering and neural nets drive **1B+ hours of watch time daily**.

### Gmail  
Serving **1.8 billion** users, it uses priority inbox algorithms, spam filters (Bayesian models), and security protocols to deliver reliable, fast mail.

### Maps  
Real-time traffic routing, ETA prediction, and geo-query optimizations help guide over **1 billion** users, contributing to a projected value of **$34.56B** by 2025.

### Google Cloud
